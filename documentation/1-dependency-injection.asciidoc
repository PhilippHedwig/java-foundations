= Dependency-Injection

We want to play around with spring and test dependency-injection.
Therefore we create packages, interfaces, and classes as in the following diagram:

So the idea is as followin:

* We create two components: `CompoentA` and `ComponentB`
* `ComponentB` can say hi to a given name by returning `"Hello " + name`
* `ComponentA` uses `ComponentB` to return a greeting (e.g. `return sayHi("World")`)
* Each component has an interface and an implementation
* Implementation is annotated with `@Named`
* `ComponentAImpl` uses `ComponentB` and gets it via `@Inject` annotation.
* Write a JUnit test `ComponentATest` that verifies the expected result of `greet()`
